## Baccarat Game with Java GUI

Welcome to the Baccarat Game with Java GUI repository! This project implements a Baccarat game using Java, following object-oriented programming principles and featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing. Baccarat is a classic card game often played in casinos, and this project brings the excitement of the game to your computer screen.

### Features

- **GUI Implementation**: The game features an intuitive graphical interface, allowing players to interact with the game seamlessly.

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game logic is structured using object-oriented programming principles, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Baccarat Rules Adherence**: The game adheres to the standard rules of Baccarat, providing an authentic gaming experience. Users can bet on either Player or Dealer("Banker") or not bet at all for each round. If the total value of the first 2 cards of Player and Dealer results in a draw a third card shall not be drawn. Only when the first 2 cards of either Player or Dealer add ups to a value of less than 5 then shall a third card be drawn.

- **Player Interaction**: Players can place bets, observe game outcomes, and enjoy the thrill of Baccarat from the comfort of their computer.
